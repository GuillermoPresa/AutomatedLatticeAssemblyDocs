\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class for controlling the camera movement. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_movement}{Movement}} is currently finicky for this application. Alternatives shall be explored. Code written by Windexglow. Original creator comment below \begin{DoxyVerb}   Writen by Windexglow 11-13-10.  Use it, edit it, steal it I don't care.  
   Converted to C# 27-02-13 - no credit wanted.
   Simple flycam I made, since I couldn't find any others made public.  
   Made simple to use (drag and drop, done) for regular keyboard layout  
   wasd : basic movement
   shift : Makes camera accelerate
   space : Moves camera on X and Z axis only.  So camera doesn't gain any height
